name: Variables
description: |
  Information can be stored in special "containers" called variables. This allows you to reuse existing data and avoid duplicating it in different parts of the code. In this module, we will learn how to modify variables and name them in a way that is understandable for any developer reading your code. You will understand that coming up with a variable name is not that simple! We will also explain how to use variables to simplify complex calculations.
